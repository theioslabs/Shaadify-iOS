## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🔹 Xcode Version

- **Latest stable (Aug 2025):** Xcode 15.x (ships with Swift 5.9/5.10).  
- Supports iOS 17/18 SDKs, modern SwiftUI, and Swift Concurrency.  
- Apple generally drops support for very old macOS in each major Xcode release.  

**👉 Recommendation:**  
- **Minimum Xcode:** 15.0 (first release with Swift 5.9, async/await stable, SwiftUI improvements).  
- **Recommended Xcode:** Latest stable (15.x or newer) → ensures compatibility with iOS 18 SDK.  

---

## 🔹 macOS Version

- Xcode requires fairly recent macOS versions.  
- Xcode 15.x requires **macOS Ventura (13.0)** or later.  
- macOS **Sonoma (14)** and **Sequoia (15)** are already common in 2025.  

**👉 Recommendation:**  
- **Minimum macOS:** 13.0 (Ventura)  
- **Recommended macOS:** 14.0 (Sonoma) or 15.0 (Sequoia) → better stability and long-term support.
